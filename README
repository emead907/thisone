To run the tests, copy all of the files to a directory on Onyx.

Copy your CircuitTracer.java, CircuitBoard.java, and other files
needed to run your program to the same directory.

To change the permissions on the process file to make it executable, type
on the command-line:

   chmod 775 process 

To run the script, type on the command-line:

   ./process > output

All of your invalid files should print exception information on the console.

Open the file "output" with a simple text editor, like kWrite.

Your output should look something like this:

     ./valid1.dat
     - ./valid1.dat Storage using stack
     stack-diff:
     end stack-diff

     - ./valid1.dat Storage using queue
     queue-diff:
     end queue-diff

     - ./valid1.dat Storage using stack: GUI
     GUI is not supported at this time.

     - ./valid1.dat Storage using queue: GUI
     GUI is not supported at this time.

Between stack-diff: end stack-diff, there may be lines  beginning with a
'<' or a '>', but there should only be white space after them.
Your GUI message may be slightly different too.
